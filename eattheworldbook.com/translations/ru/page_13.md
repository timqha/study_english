Explanation 3. Programs must be written for people to read

When I wrote this, only God and I understood what I was doing. Now, God only knows.

Programmers spend a lot of time on reading and understanding the code, so it is very important to make it easier for them.

If the solution used seems obvious, it does not mean that it will still be in the next weeks or months â€“ especially when new people join the project.

The 3D Pinball game available on Windows XP system was not included in the new system versions because of poor code quality and lack of documentation. Microsoft programmers could not understand how the game worked, so in connection with other tasks they abandoned the idea of porting it to a newer system version[1].
