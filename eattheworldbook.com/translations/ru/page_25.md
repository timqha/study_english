Explanation 1. How do we really talk to the computers

There are only 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary and those who don't.

Binary number is composed of elements called bits, which can take one of two states (0 or 1). Binary number 10 is 2 in decimal and therefore, two types of people are mentioned in the above joke.

Binary numbers are converted to decimal numbers as follows:

10 is 1*(2^1) + 0*(2^0) = 2
1001 is 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 9
1101 is 1*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 13
The use of binary code in computers is very effective. State 0 (bit off) and 1 (on) can be represented by low and high voltage.
