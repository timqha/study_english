Explanation 3. People start counting from the number one

There are two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors[1].

Off-by-one is a programming error occurring[2] when you make a mistake such as starting from 1 when you should start from 0. In modern programming languages, the initial element of a sequence usually is assigned the index 0.

[1] As lampshadish2 pointed out, this joke plays on famous quote by Phil Karlton who orginally said "There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things".
[2] knome noted that this error mostly occurs when a programmer incorrectly checks bounds of an array (for example, attempting to take the third item of a list of only two).
