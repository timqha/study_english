Explanation 13. Of all the things I've lost, I miss my mind the most

People can be divided into two groups: those who do backups, and those who will.

Backup is a copy of data that, for example, can be used to restore software after a failure. Creating backups is a very good practice.

A serious incident in 2017 was GitLab loss of data. Despite creating backups, it turned out that they were not well-tested and some of the data could not be restored[1].

Create backups and check whether you can recover data from them as often as possible.
