Explanation 2. Information representation

A guy walks into a bar and asks for 1.4 root beers. The bartender says "I'll have to charge you extra, that's a root beer float".

The guy says "In that case, better make it a double."

Computers using binary code store the stream of zeros and ones in memory. When creating software, the task of programmer is to tell the computer how to interpret this stream.

For example, the binary code 1000001 stored in the computerâ€™s memory could mean a letter A, or an integer number 65.

Back to the joke, floats and doubles are a way to store numbers in computer's memory with a fractional component. A double has double the precision and the size as a float. Because the guy asks for 1.4 this cannot be an integer (number without a fractional component) but must be a float or double.

Double is almost always better choice for numbers with a fraction because it's more precise (although, it uses more computer's memory)[1].
